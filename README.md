## Running the server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

we are going to continue to run in development because there is no need to change this.


## Snags
Dont forget to *npm install*

I anticipate that the @types/animejs fomr /node_modules/@types/animejs will complain, the step to fix is to remove any reference to the word 'object' swap it for 'any' and also remove the preceeding '|' pipe from one of the difinitions, I cannot recal which one but it will stand out.

I also have a working version of this file if required.

## Speech
Recognition is still temprimental, if it craps out, just let the user fill out without, by pressing the start over button at the end of the journey, this will reset the app.

Cheers
